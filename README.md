# Blanagram
Blanagram project


Each word must use the same letters as the previous word (like anagrams), but for one letter that you can replace with any new letter.

These are called blanagrams . A blanagram is like an anagram with one letter as a joker (blank tile)

Example: EAGLE -> AGREE -> GREET -> TREES
